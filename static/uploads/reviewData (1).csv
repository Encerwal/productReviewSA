"Cut More than 1000 Times Cleanly  This cutter has lasted more than a year of daily use. It is better than all of the other cutters sold on Amazon. (I tried them all.)

How to potty train a chihuahua  I bought these diapers in size small for my chihuahuas since they were peeing on everything and pooping all over. These diapers were these dogs savor. Now I use the diaper along with the male wrap and my little guys hold their bowls until they can be taken outside. In case they do pee or poop these diapers catch everything and can be machine washed easily. Now my husband is happy and my puppies are apart of the house again. It's a lot cheaper to buy these diapers than replace the carpet in my house. Yay    ,1

It's easy to use that my toddler started to use it with us, his baby brother and our cat. It's definitely a fun way to check one's temperature.

"It turns up to 11.  Wow, beyond impressed with this speaker; being a bit of a music and tech nerd I wasn't expecting much from a $10 speaker. I was just looking for something that would make my Alexa morning routine sound a bit better in my bedroom. I have my whole home set up to play music and the dot 2nd gen just sounded terrible compared to the Input I have connected to my very nice, high end stereo system and another room connected to a $600 pair of bookshelf speakers. I feel it packs a powerful punch for such a small speaker and price. To the reviews I read that said it doesn't get loud enough- I can only assume they hate their neighbors and having ear drums because this thing can get way louder than I will ever need or want it to be. At an appropriate listening volume and proper placement in a room the sound is very impressive for the price point. The fact that it is portable is an added bonus.    ",1

THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. FAULTY AND AMAZON WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  This worked perfectly in my tank for about six months. After six months it immediately stopped working.

000% Grade A Crap  This thing looks like a Detroit rat that has rolled around in the sewers and been in and out of gang fights all it's life. The fur looks like they literally found whatever lint ball pieces of crap lying around and glued them onto its body. I am SUPER pissed because they looked really cute in the pictures.... Time to send this rat back to whatever crap hole it originated from.    ,0

It has been sitting on it for 8 days now and it is still only 0/4"" thick except for where it was folded during delivery (and therefore not fully compressed). It is as if it was stored so long in a fully compressed state that it no longer has the ability to expand. I even flipped it after 4 days. On the plus side, it never did have that odor others mention. No way to ship back.    ",0

"Thank you Ms. Hamilton for helping me fall asleep at night! Anita Blake series helps insomnia!  Thank you Ms. Hamilton for helping me fall asleep at night! As with many other Anita Blake fans, I am pondering the reason I purchased this latest book in the series. No plot, no excitement. It is filled with so many descriptive elements of what characters are wearing, the exact shade and length of their hair and their percentage of body fat. Why do we need to know that someone's hair looks coarse from across a room? I was surprised that it did not include the fabric content and a link to purchase their clothing as well. Pages of confusion in deciding who's lap Anita should sit on in a vehicle. I found myself constantly skipping ahead to find content that had some actual bearing on the story. It improved slightly after they arrived on the island, but I still found it lacking anything interesting. Anita didn't do anything in this story that a human woman couldn't have done. Please, please Ms. Hamilton, dig deep and write another kick ass story.    ",0

"Works well  I installed this peephole in my metal garage door so I can see what's going on in my driveway/street without having to run inside and look out the window. It took about 1 minutes to install. I happened to already have a step drill bit that included the somewhat odd size required (my DeWalt bit set doesn't go up that big). The peephole has a nice angle of view and is crisp and clear. It looks discreet, and I like the little rotating cover so there won't be a point of light when viewed from the street. I have two garage doors, so I am considering getting another one for the other side of the garage.    ",1

"Super bright. Well-built and insulated. Very cool lights!!  Superbright LED light for a very cool look on your car! Well-built. The rubber surround and backing is a bit thick but provides the necessary heat shielding for these high brightness lights.

I mounted these LED strips on top of my headlamp plastic assembly, and drilling tiny holes through the edges of the rubber strip mount to fasten them with the provided screws (see pictures). This will ensure that they will stay on if/when the glue backing begins to give, even after many car washes, etc.    ",1

"Misleading product info  I ordered this planner and was very excited for it to come, but became very disappointed upon receiving it. I thought I was getting a year-long planner but this only works for 6 months, and you have to go through the work of writing in all the dates yourself! It makes no sense that the weekly pages are in a completely different section than the daily pages because who has the time to flip back and forth through all those pages? The idea of daily and weekly goal setting and intentions is what drew me to this product, but it is completely disorganized! The pages are also low quality and unattractive. The product description promised so much but didn't actually detail the number of pages or what the planner could be used for. I think this could work if you are just trying to focus on a few goals for a short period of time. It does not work as a daily planner. Returning it and going back to my tried and true Day Designer!    ",0
"The Mosquito Slayer!  This thing works great on mosquitoes! I live in Florida and have a massive mosquito population of my back porch. I just got this about 2 weeks ago. I was worried the rechargeable battery would die off after a few zaps, but this thing keeps going strong after killing, and I'm not exaggerating, 10 + mosquitoes in the course of five minutes. I've had other racket zappers that are battery operated. They tend to give you five to 10 good zaps & then start to taper off. even with the D cell batteries. This one goes strong for hours. In the past I had to clean the bug corpses out of the racket head, but this one has such a powerful discharge that it tends to vaporize them on contact! The package says 2400 volts, I was expecting 4000 but it doesn't seem to matter it's got plenty of muscle! Death to the flying vampires!    ",1

My favorite flip flops ever!  I originally bought these from Macys but my dog chewed them apart. I searched everywhere and found them on Amazon for about $10 less and was so happy. They are the best flips flops I've ever had. The sole is foam and very comfy to walk for miles on. The thong is fabric and does not bother between my toes at all like some cheap plastic flip flops do. The only thing is if your feet are wet they may squeak a little from wet foot against foam but I don't care because they are comfy. Love these Roxy sandals!    ,1

"Tough Read  This was a tough book to finish. I almost gave up around 30%, then again at 41%. I stuck with it because I truly liked the idea of the story, but the writing style is so hard to follow. I'm sure there was research done on the manner of speaking for the period the story is set in, but it was hard to connect to the story or it's characters because the writing was so hard to follow. The storyline is choppy, jumping from one time to another and back again. The story itself had potential, but there just wasn't any development of the characters or their relationship. I fell asleep several times on this one...    ",0

"So far these are one of the best quality bluetooth headsets I have tried  So far these are one of the best quality bluetooth headsets I have tried. I accidently spilled coffee on them this morning, was able to take the earbuds off, and clean them with a damp paper towel and they work fine! I listen to audiobooks working and driving, you do get approximately 13 hours of constant use, and (if you remember to turn it off in between uses) you can get 3-4 days if you only use it on your commute to and from work. (I have roughly a 3 hour commute, and didn't have to charge it for 3 days). The sound is very clear. When I first turn them on, there is some static sound, but music and audiobooks are very clear. The earbuds are also extremely comfortable, I was worried about the addition of the ""in ear"" feature into the upper ear, but I love it! I look forward to using these and will buy this brand in the future if needed.    ",1

"Amazing customer service  Great product! Great service. Adorable packaging - you can tell a lot of care has gone into the creation of this product. There is a learning curve to use this for sure! And if you remember back to your young days, using a tampon took a little getting used to also. But the instructions and customer service, I promise, will promptly answer any question you have. They'll help you with your experience and ease your concerns. I definitely recommend not cutting the little tab until you wear it for a few periods, because where it feels comfortable seems to change based on the day of my period. Also, I can't exclusively use this, which is OK! It still reduces how many tampons I need to buy. I feel my body get tired after having it in for 12 hours, and so I need it to rest for the next day or overnight.    ",1

Extremely Biased  This has been one of the most poorly written books in the area of medical sociology that I have ever encountered.

"Perfect Case  This case is awesome. I got the 'Flavor of the Month' iPhone X case and it's amazing. It holds up to 4 cards very secure. I haven't had any problems with them falling out, even when I just have one card in the case.

I've also dropped my phone on plenty of different surfaces and there were no cracks or scrapes! The only negative thing I would say about the case is about the grip. I expected the edges to be a bit tacky but they were not. Instead, they are a textured hard plastic but it is still very easy to hold.

Even if you can get it to finally seat, you cannot turn it completely to lock in place.

I'm really surprised, na baskilin na nga ako, nag gym pa ako and all, nag pawis na ako lahat lahat, still wala pa rin akong amoy, unscented talaga siya, and hindi ka talaga maco-conscious sa amoy mo once na gamit mo ito. Para naman sa sweetness, wala siya gaanong help. Siguro dahil wala naman talagang deo na makakatanggal ng pag s-sweat, sakit na kasi yun, need na ipa consult sa doctor. Also, if nakakakita kayo ng recos sa tiktok na nakakatanggal ng baskil at amoy, oo effective pero ang DOWNSIDE nakaka itim ng kilikili. Hindi ko nilalahat iba't iba tayo ng body, I'm just sharing my experience. Para sa akin mas okay na to kesa sa ibang deos, hindi ka magkaka amoy kahit mag pawis ka nang wagas.

The elastic straps and metal hooks also required some engineering, but they are holding very securely now and the seat covers look really great in the SUV.

Frustrated - Stopped after 0 use  I tried to return it but I missed the return window by 0! Day. I am really frustrated. I used it the first them for shredding cheese and it worked fantastic. I was busy and didn't get to use it again until a few days ago when I wanted to use the blade attachment for strawberry puree. It'll spin with nothing in the bowl but if you add cut strawberries you can hear it try to rotate but it won't. It's useless now. I am really frustrated I've had it since the beginning of March so barely a month. I expected more. Not sure what to do now.    ,0

"Awsome  It comes with 2 pieces. When I received the package, my first impression is that how can it be so light. Instantly I was starting to worry if it will be able to hold enough weight. Once set up, I tested it by sitting on every corner and the center on it, and it held up pretty well. Then I tested it with two people, around 310 lbs total, and still held up surprisingly well. That was my main concern and everything else seems quite fine. The interior is spacious. The leather on top feels comfortable. It's light enough to be portable if/when needed.    ",1

"Great Coffee- especially on the go  The aeropress is simple and easy to use, and both my wife and I think it makes a superb cup of coffee. We still do drip coffee on weekdays just because it's a little easier, but the aeropress is our weekend treat (that still doesn't require much work). Where it really shines though, is when traveling. As long as you can boil water, you can have good coffee. At home, in a hotel, an RV or camping, it's portable enough to take with you. We recently took the aeropress on a month long camping trip. Great coffee in the middle of nowhere was the perfect way to start the day, especially compared to the instant stuff which would have been our other option.    ",1
"Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed. My search for a color safe fragrance free ...  I bought this because it said no artificial fragrance, and was safe for color treated hair. The fragrance part is true but I think they meant standard hair colors because this was absolutely not true for me. If you use fashion colors, this shampoo is not safe to use.

Why did I sweat so much?  I am clearly the exception (it would seem) but here under shirts --- that are sweat proof -- seemed to increase my core temperature by 20-30 degrees. Ok - I am exaggerating but I was traveling by car and pulled over to take my shirt and tie off and rid myself of the undershirt so that I could cool down before my meeting. How? How does this work for others but makes me hot & sweaty. I bought two shirts and two underpants - I will say that the underpants seem better but truthfully I think the shirt experience sullied the whole deal.    ,0

"Best TPU case for this tablet  First of all, know that this doesn't allow the tablet to cool as well, so it does increase the chance of overheating, which I've experienced. That's an issue with all cases, but I wanted to note it so someone doesn't blame the product when they should know better. Now you do! This installs easily, and fits tight. Everything that needs a hole has it. There's a small lip around the bezel, but I haven't seen anything else with a shorter lip. In this regard, this case is the best available. There's a bit of flash around the edges where the molds come together, so it's not visually perfect, however this does not affect functionality, and I can only feel it if I try. Altogether this performs great for the money.    ",1

Cheaply made switches  Switches look good but that is where the quality stops. I wired all my lights with fuses before the switch so the supplied wiring was not used. When removing the supplied wiring I had 9 or the factory terminals pull out of the switch while pulling the wiring connector off the terminals. The terminals were able to push back into the switch and felt tight so I wired things up. Had everything working but on the first ride 0 switch failed. When looking for the problem with that switch 2 more failed. So right now only 3 of the 6 switches are usable. Not a good average.    ,0

Really cool bag and worth the money.  The concept of the bag is great. Definitely secure. Better than what I was expecting actually and plenty big. I agree there is a hole the size of a medicine bottle at the top but what are people going to take? Loose change? There is an extra zipper inside to secure small stuff. There is no way someone would be able to pull a Gopro in a waterproof housing out so the hole doesn't matter much. I wouldn't let this bag out of my sight if I can help it because it could be stolen with proper tools but the average public thief is looking for a quick grab and not something he/she has to work for in plain view.    ,1

Price dropped right after I bought it. I want credit!  I am very upset. I just opened the box and I was checking the product description and noticed that the price has dropped by 18 dollars since I ordered this week. I called in and in order to get the lower price I need to pack it up and order a return and buy a new one. Thus is just to much work for me. It's heavy and I live alone.    ,0

Stainless does not keep ice where as my red one does  I have purchased 3 of these. I bought a red one for myself & loved it so much that I ordered a stainless one for my Father my husband asked where his was so I ordered him a stainless one. My red one keeps things very cold & holds ice nicely all day! My Dad lives in another city so I don't have 0st hand knowledge of his. My husband really didn't use his so recently I have started using it some while mine is being washed. His stainless does not hold ice & the outside has condensation. It's too late to return thru Amazon so I'm hoping that the manufacturer of COLD 0 will reach out to me so that I can exchange this.    ,0

Missing pieces  Package arrived on time. We got the cheaper one that had been opened before. It had some dings in it which we expected for the lower price. What we didn't expect was that we were missing one of the pivot balls needed for installation. We ended up going to Home Depot and used two pieces of PVC caps to remedy that. Now the bottom piece won't stay in place while in the pool. Still working on this project so we can actually use this ladder. Amazon offered a 1 dollar credit for next order and also to send it back to order a new one. We threw away the boxes and didn't want the hassle of sending back. We would not order this again.    ,0

"Off to the trash heap!  A nice idea that is undone by the poor quality. The batteries are a clamshell construction of some brittle plastic. Within a week the two halves had separated. This is likely to occur since when they are inserted into the heel of the insole, there is just a little indent to grab it with your finger, right along the seam. There would be a little tab that allows you to pull the battery out of the insole They replaced the defective pair and the same thing happened with the replacement. I tried to glue the batteries back together but they continue to split. It is also hard to tell if they are working. There is a little green light that flashes when turned on, but it is hidden when inserted. There have been times that one turns on and the other doesn't. Now I have four cracked batteries and no functioning insoles after spending nearly $000 With a better design, better engineering, better materials, and some quality control. this could be a good product. Until then, save your money    ",0

However, my 92 pound Dalmatian, who loves to pull when he sees squirrels, chipmunks, etc. However, so far it has held up well and I will keep using it. Having a waterproof leash is great, especially when it is raining (which it has been doing for the last week here!). Also it is super visible at night which is great as it starts getting dark earlier at night and stays dark in the morning. I would definitely recommend this.    ",1

Received wrong size kayak  Buyer beware. I saw the other review stating they received the wrong size but took my chances and unfortunately we also received the 60 instead of the 66. It's smaller and only goes to weight limit of 030 which is not enough for what we need. Hope the company makes it right. Such a disappointment. Fingers crossed it can be replaced before the birthday for which it was to be a gift.    ,0
nice looking but cardboard backing. Not wood.  My son is 11 and put it together in 3.1 hours. Its quite heavy and will require two people probably. What I like the least- cardboard back. Rest of unit seems very sturdy. Instructions were well done and all parts were there.    ,1

"Very nice indeed  I have 2 Blackstone 12 inch domes but find that I almost always need a smaller one when cooking stir fry. I just got this smaller dome yesterday and put it to immediate use covering the thinly sliced chicken I cooked for the stir fry dish I cooked. As it is smaller, it takes up less room on my 4 burner Camp Chef griddle and because it is smaller it also does a better job of helping cook the chicken and of keeping it warm once the chicken is cooked. These domes make for a small oven of sorts and when using a griddle are a must. I use this and my other domes to melt cheese on burgers, to steam vegetables, and to keep warm whatever I have cooked that I am not ready to take off the griddle. Of note is the fact that the handle may get hot, so caution is warranted when cooking with high temperatures and especially when used for long periods on a hot grill. However, in last night's cook, The handle was only warm. It's a well made and attractive dome. I give it 2 thumbs up.    ",1

I immediately sent off a question to the vendor and waited 3 days but heard nothing. I then sent off another email 3 days ago and have still heard nothing. I did not get what I paid for and nobody with their organization has even tried to fix the situation. I feel completely taken advantage of and I will never order anything from this vendor again.

"Great price, poor quality.  We looked all over Amazon for a new set of luggage and finally settled on this set after comparing price and reviews. Our main concern was the durability of the set. Well our fears were realized on our 0st trip. The luggage was nice and light, rolled well, had great space inside but when we picked up our luggage at the baggage claim, the largest one was missing a wheel. It had completely ripped off of the case, exposing the fabric inside the shell. The middle one lost one of the bumpers on it's spine, exposing two metal studs. Luckily United had 2 new suitcases that they swapped out right then and there for us. It just seemed like the better way to go instead of filing a claim and purchasing this set a 2nd time. We really wanted to like the set too...pretty bummed at the quality.    ",0

"Perfect garden shoe!  These were a little tight intially, but better tight than slipping off foot. They now fit exactly as they should, after several wears, and they don't seem to be getting any looser. These are wonderful for in the garden, or walking around the grass. I would urge avoiding sticker/goats head weeds, as the stickers go right through the material and into feet! Ouch! But at least when you pull your foot out the thorn doesn't stay in your foot! But still, best to avoid thorns and stickers. I like being barefoot most of the time. But these garden shoes are wonderful. I bought my husband a pair as well, to keep him from tracking dirt everywhere. A quick rinse off with the hose before coming in, and my floors are saved!    ",1

"Beware of the seller  Rarely do I write a less than favorable review, but in this case, the product itself was fine however when it did not arrive in time and meet my needs, I found the need to return it. After discussions with the seller he agreed to refund but shipping was my cost and responsibility. When I asked for clarification about this, as it was not easily seen under the product listing, I was told by the seller that shipping is At the responsibility and cost of the purchaser who chose to return, as that is the way the seller can keep his products more affordable. The cost for me to return this was almost equal to the cost of purchasing it in the first place. This information should be made VERY apparent to someone considering purchasing this product or anything from this particular company. Despite that the product itself may be excellent, return policy, particularly with the shipping is very expensive, in my opinion not worth the consideration of business with this particular company at all!

Not only has nothing worked in the past, but he's actually scratched his cornea trying to remove products from his snout. I forgot what his nose looked like under the dry scales that formed on his nose. After only three applications, all of the dry scales have fallen off. My boys nose is completely smooth and moist, and no longer dry and crusty. This stuff is incredible!!    ",1

"A massive disappointment with some misogyny added for good measure  I had really high hopes for this band. Maybe that's why I'm so disappointed in it. The one thing it has going for it is its appearance, and I don't think that's enough reason to deal with its shortcomings. The section with the stars pops out slightly and maybe there's a reason for that, but it ends up picking up additional gunk and is extremely difficult to clean, in part due to all the star cutouts. Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous. For the price of this band, you can do much better. The stars may make it unique (and I love almost everything with stars on it) but it doesn't make up for everything else.    ",0

Stays firmly in place  I purchased the GOMA mount to use in the car with my GP Hero 7 Black. The first couple of times I attached it to the windshield when I wanted to use it.

Got so excited, It works and leaves your pores feeling fresh. What's more, opening your pores with a warm towel, dry, and then use the device. Finish with cold water to close your pores.I recon consistent use will keep my nose and pores in good beautiful working order.    ",1

Putting the large turntable in there solved this problem. I like the non-slip surface and bottom on the turntables, and once they are in place and loaded up they turn easily and seem very sturdy.

"Great wrist support  Great wrist support! Both my sister and mother uses this wrist support. They both use it for different reasons, which makes this product so versatile. First off, my mother has had carpal tunnel surgery. Her hands and wrist aren't as strong as before; therefore this wrist support has tremendously helped her lift heavier items. Secondly, my sister uses this when she plays tennis. At times, she has multiple tennis matches in one day. After holding a racket for some time, her wrists should be shaky at times. The wrist support reduces the tension and shakiness from her wrist and she is able to continue playing tennis comfortably. Overall, it is a great product. Material is nice and it is very easy to put on and take off.    ",1

Unfortunately, if I read the reviews for this item then I would have known better. These ARE NOT Schick razors. I am not sure why Amazon is still allowing this misleading product description. I suppose it would be fine if they were a true knock off, but as mentioned in other reviews, these razors don't have the flip top allowing you to shave tight places. So for me, the lack of this feature makes the razors worthless because I need a totally different razor to finish the job.    ",0

"suction is too strong, material is hard  this cup is too long for me, and very difficult to fold to make it shorter once its inside. nice idea though. its rims are rigid making it hard to insert. it is even more difficult to pull out, due to the placement of the holes. if you pinched it half way, it doesnt release the suction, and if you dig all the way up to pinch it, it scrapes uncomfortably against the cervix, not to mention the accidental pinching of the vaginal walls by my fingernails (and i keep my nails short). And after all, the whole reason that i bought this is because i am tight and shallow down there. I'm not a doctor, but based on my experience with this cup so far. I have had so much trouble removing this that i felt it tug on my uterus, and after pulling it out, I had abdominal cramps. I do not recommend this cup for the reason that its suction on the cervix is so strong. I don't doubt that if you pulled carelessly enough it might cause some serious problems.    ",0

"soft, easy to use, great for avoiding dog eating ""everything"" when taking a walk  We measured the dog prior to purchasing yet this was just a little bit too big upon receipt so we had to return it. This is unfortunate as the muzzle is super soft, comfortable for a dog to wear, and adjustable (just not adjustable small enough for our smaller dog). Other reviewers state the dog can tear this off. Our purpose was to walk the dog and have him be able to breathe, bark, pant, etc., just not pick up objects from the ground. This would have been PERFECT!! I would not leave a dog to not try to remove this is for a wound or for biting or other aggressive behavior. However, to avoid licking while being observed or to avoid eating things without restricting other normal dog behavior, this is a really great design and product. Had this fit, the dog also did not balk at it being on him as we attempted to make the sizing work. I am sure various dogs will tolerate differently yet that isn't the fault of product design or quality.    ",1

"Very uncomfortable! Too soft, no support whatsoever.  This is an extremely uncomfortable pillow. It offers no back support whatsoever while leaning against it. It makes trying to read or with tv most unpleasant, and reading is supposed to be the point of this item. In fact, it makes the back sink inward, creating a backache. It's useless to me. I only wish I'd thought of retuning it sooner (I don't use it everyday and I wanted to give it a fair chance).

Great item for the price.  My wife has been looking for a detachable style shower head with a big surface area. All the major home improvement stores had only one or the other of the of what she was looking for... And at a much higher price. The nut that connects to the pipe is metal. The included Teflon makes installation quick and easy. The only thing I am not crazy about is the length of the hose that is connected to the shower head. But I am sure I could replace it with a shorter one. Definitely not a deal breaker... But it is a little annoying that the hose hits the faucet handle. First time installation without any leaks and after 4 months or so it is still solid. We are running about 60 psi in the house and this shower head performs well. Very happy with this product. Easy to clean with a wipe of the towel as well.    ,1
Very nice wallet  I love the color I got...it's more of a teal than green and really gorgeous. The only thing I wish was different is...could you make the plastic window clear so you can see through it...I like to put my driver's license in these slots. Enough credit card slots for me and I like the size.    ,1

"Recommended and fits 40 mm perfectly  Case fits 40 mm watch perfectly and is easy to install/remove. I like that the edges are slightly raised to help protect the screen and that there is no plastic piece over the screen itself. Well made. UPDATE: While I still really like this case after using it for a few days I discovered there is a problem. Dust and fibers from your clothes get caught under it and you have to remove the case to clean frequently. Its really visible and looks terrible. So while I like the design I would lower it to three stars as it traps dust, fiber and dirt so easily.    ",1

Good purchase. Happy with the price and quality.  I love this thing! Really do! My wife has one and I wanted one just like it so I bought this.

His tone is so abrasive, and so is his language. If you've ever been in a verbally/emotionally abusive relationship, this book may trigger you. It should come with a trigger warning. I got so triggered I ripped it up and threw it out before finishing chapter two. I will not attempt to start or finish again.    ",0

"I give these roller covers my highest recommendation  Absolutely fantastic roller covers at a reasonable price. I initially attempted to paint my car garage interior using the ""best"" quality roller cover from Home Depot (purple color) and the higher-end Purdy roller cover from Sherwin Williams. Unfortunately, both of those roller covers gave me uneven results and the roller covers kept sliding down off the roller once they became heavy with paint. I ordered these Wooster Pro/Doo-Z covers because I just couldn't stand the frustration of the other roller covers. It was well worth the wait for the Wooster Pro/Doo-Z covers to arrive from Amazon because I got much better results using it without any problems or frustration. I painted the entire garage using a single Pro/Doo-Z roller cover. It held up great and never soaked up too much paint. The wall coverage was nice and even, and most importantly, the roller cover never slid down the roller.    ",1

I'm pregnant and have been really low on energy since before taking this, and I have noticed a difference in my energy levels after a few days of taking this.    ",1

In that hour, she started tearing the green rubber off of the shank. There was a smooth metal tube under the rubber. I had to take the bone away to prevent her from swallowing the green rubber pieces or breaking her teeth on the metal tube. Does the dog love it, Yes. Is it durable, NO. Is it dangerous, Possibly; if she swallows the rubber or breaks her teeth on the metal tube. Not something you can leave with the dog and walk away.    ",0

I was hoping this would have worked as I wanted the blue light filter for my phone. For the cost of the screen protector, it was worth the cost. As for the durability, I had no complaints. I didn't install it on my phone since I couldn't use the screen guide and sent everything back to Amazon. If you order this, maybe the company will have fixed it by then.    ",0

"First Impressions are important!!!!  So, I just received the Blast Softball device literally 00 minutes ago. I opened my Amazon box very excited. But to my dismay, my product box looks beat up and the stickers that seal it have already been opened. Trying to give this the benefit of the doubt, I went ahead and checked the contents. Everything seemed to be okay, but then when I checked the rubber part that holds the sensor on the bat, it was dirty!!! It has lint and what may be cat hair on it!!!!! WTH!!!! I believe I got someone's sloppy seconds. I didn't order a used product and I certainly wasn't charged a used price. Not a good way to start off Blast! And I was so excited for my daughter to get started with this product!! UPDATE: this item has TOTALLY been used before. Downloaded the app and tried registering the sensor and it is already registered to another account. I am so PISSED!!!!    ",0

Come to find out either the controller is broken or the portal software is.... Quick search and I find this is a common issue.... Yet support seems to be clueless.    ",0

"Waste of time and money!  Save your time and money, and do NOT buy this sight pusher. It is very poorly made, difficult to deal with, frustrating to use, and it scuffs up your sights even if you put something between the sights and the pusher. I used this to change out the sights on a few Glocks, and saying it was a hassle is an understatement, however I eventually got the job done. When I used this sight pusher to change out the sights on my M&P Shield it was a nightmare. I barely got the factory back sights off and couldn't even get the front sight off. If you're just changing out the sights on a few guns, then do yourself a favor and take your guns to a local gun shop. Most gun shops will install sights for $00 or less. If you're dead set on changing out your own sights, more power to you, but spend the extra money for a quality sight pusher. Do not buy this one! This sight pusher is not worth the time and stress.    ",0

"Another great one by Penelope Ward  I love Penelope Ward, like so much I always end up reading her new releases the night they come out. When I saw that this book was going to be able two peoples who relationship started over the internet I knew this book was going to be one I was going to love. I love when the foundation of a relationship is set up before the two people even meet, it really forces you to connect with the characters more and be more invested in them and their lives. Ryder was an interesting character. He's smart and hard working, I felt like he was still trying to prove to his dad that he was going to be ready to take over for him one day, but at the same time he was also having some second thoughts, like he hasn't really figured out what he wanted to do with his life yet. For someone who is always on the move with people all around him he felt very lonely to me. It wasn't surprising that he ended up reaching out to a random person online, although the fact that she was a cam girl was a little surprising. I have to say Ryder is just so lovable, he's kind to Eden, he's interested in way more than what she does for a living, and when they finally meet the way he is with her and her home life, I mean he couldn't be any more great. Eden, wow, Eden. I have a lot of respect for her, I know a lot of people look down at people who do things like be a cam girl, but sometimes in life you need money to take care of your family. And frankly she's amazing at taking care of her family. I loved seeing her and Ryder interact. I was invested in these two, and the chemistry was awesome. This was another great addition to Penelope's work, and I can't wait for the next one.    ",1

"Fails to fast charge after a couple months.  Stopped fast charging after a couple months. Leave phone overnight on charger and it's at 80% in the morning. Bought one, like it, bought another. Both failed to work after a couple months.    ",0
"Bad hardware, crappy directions  This looks great. But beware -- the directions are awful. The hardware is worse. Initially I was thinking since they were making a universal piece for connecting with different TV its difficult for them to provide clear instruction. Later I found the mounting hardware itself is suspect. I will have to go to home depot to get the right hardware since returning it will be a bigger pain and I have already invested so much time on this. In sum, unless you have plenty of time and patience, stay clear!    ",0

"That's not what other raincoats can do.  I haven't used these products yet, the raincoat used before was very heavy. It's very inconvenient to put on. So I tried this raincoat, it feels great to put on. There is no sense of obstructing action. When I opened the package, I found a variety of raincoats in different colors, each of us can choose the color we like. I think we can take it with us on the field trip. Because it was raining hard days ago, it was I who carried a raincoat like this I won't get caught in the rain, I don't even feel it. It's a great feeling. A raincoat is long enough, it won't get your knees wet. That's not what other raincoats can do. So I suggest you take a raincoat like this. It won't take up your space and it will bring you convenience.    ",1

"Does not match the picture! Horrible  This is my first bad review ever but I am very disappointed. Waited 2 weeks to receive and was totally unworthy! The quality is super cheap for the price. The handle has a hole, the buckle is totally missing. It looks like vinyl, the surface is smooth and not like the picture. The key holder is mounted upside down, missing a ring and the one showing is round not flat and not engraved. The bottom is not engraved either and inside the textile is very thin and with no tag. You can spot it's a horrible replica from afar. No dust bag and extremely poor packaging. Does not deserve even 0 star.    ",0

Worked great for a while  I've had this for about 6 months. Worked well during that period. Then all the sudden it stopped working. I thought the batteries needed changed but was suspicious because of the abrupt stop. When I opened the battery compartment it was full of soap. The batteries were all shorted out and contacts were corroded. I tried to clean them up but to no avail. It's junk! Don't waste your money...    ,0

"Capsules worl more quickly than tablets! GREAT!  I actually take caffeine as what it is: a drug. I have a condition that makes it necessary to use a stimulant to awaken (not fun). I have never seen caffeine capsules before and these are great -- they take effect more quickly than tablets which need to melt. This means that I can use less. The challenge is that there's no way to do 1.1 capsules unless you have some empty capsules around. I generally do, but haven't needed to go there with this product. I'd definitely recommend it. One wouldn't think that a caffeine product actually matters so much to a person, but in my case it does!    ",1

Works fine.  We purchased these DVD players for when our grandchildren are in the car with us. They are easy to install. Just attach them to the headrests and plug them into the 12V power source. I purchased a splitter as recommended in another review. The main learning curve was to insert the DVD with the label facing away from me. Previous DVD players we used had the DVD label facing the user. Worked fine and the sound was good on the headsets. Easy to set the infrared signal to A or B in the Setup menu. A third headset we had from a previous player worked fine with this system. We like it because it is easy to remove when the grandkids are not with us.    ,1

"Broke within 00 days.  After 8-00 days of use the frame broke. The row of middle support legs are cheap thin metal and they have felt pads to stop them from moving, whereas the wooden outter legs do not. My hubby thinks that the bed was moving each time we got in it and the middle legs were swaying, to the point that they broke. As a result we have spent the past few nights in our guest room instead of on our brand new $2k mattress. The website and amazon so far only show the option to return for a refund, and taking it apart to box and ship back does not sound like a great addition to this experience.

I wanted privacy because my bf is super nosey, always trying to read my messages as I text. First off this does come with everything you need to install it. I really liked that. Installation was simple and very easy. The first few days I didn't really have a problem with it, outside of the fact that fingerprints did stay on the screen rather easily. My problem arose when the screen protector came off. I didn't notice until I went to use my phone so I have no idea how long it was off. I cleaned the screen and put another one on, and not even 2days later it started to come off again. Although the screen works well, clearly it does not have enough adhesive to keep it stuck to the screen. I won't be buying again. I'm now on screen protector 3 in less than 2wks.    ",0

"A Grave Mistake  I rarely ever get negative side effects from over the counter medicines. In my case the reviews are true... the cramps I experienced on these pills were worst than menstrual cramps. i took them at 02am in the hopes of having that overnight relief like the box mentions. I woke up at 0am with the worst cramps I've ever experienced in my life and extremely nauseous, sweating and questioning humanity. It's now 1am, after many hours of being in the bathroom I got SOME relief by vomiting and taking an ice cold shower... if you're like me and just reading some of the negative reviews now because you've made the grave mistake of consuming this medicine, my advice to you is to try vomiting and do not lie down just sit up till the time passes...

"Absolutely Best Foam/Sponge Rollers I've Ever Used!!!  I very rarely leave a review - but this product is so stellar I felt compelled. I have fine, thin hair. Almost every other type of roller damages my hair causing it to break off. These rollers have a plastic core that makes them more rigid than any other foam roller - so they make the rolling up part much easier as they hold their shape and don't compress. I do not use the black self lock bar because it puts a ""dent"" in my hair. I use the thin clips/pins from my old hot rollers. They slide easily over the roller and hold it in place. If I need more clips I order these: Pro Touch Assorted Hot Roller Clips, 12 Count. I half way dry my hair and then use the rollers. If it gets too dry I spritz with water. Then I use the blow dryer to dry each roller. I put on my makeup, get dressed and then they are dry and I take them out and have firm, long lasting curls. BTW, i do use gel on my wet hair. I often sleep on my hair (no rollers) and it still looks good the 2nd day! I have short - medium length hair.    ",1

It has the features I was looking for: AirPrint, two trays, scanner that can scan and e-mail, etc. I often use the scan to e-mail which worked perfect with my gmail account. However, with the two trays I can put envelopes in one and normal copy paper in the other and it will work fine. However, when I use cardstock and normal copy paper, the printer cannot distinguish between the two and the software won't let you pick which tray to print from. The replacement ink cartridges are now still over $000 for the multi-set which is ridiculous, with no other remanufactured options (currently). I would not purchase an epson in the future due to the ink cartridge pricing scheme.    ",0

Custom service not replying back to fix the stitching  I liked the product. It fit perfect on my truck and easy to setup. The only issue I had was the stitching has came apart after less than a year and I can't close the cover now. I have been sending return and exchange requests for a year. Even called Truxedo but since I bought it through amazon they have to file the claim. I have requested a return or exchange but have not heard back from Amazon or the seller.    ,0

Safe and secure iPad and pen!  Love it! Very thick and sturdy makes the iPad feel secure and safe. Perfect side pocket for the pen also makes it feel secure but not too tight also has a spot for the charging adapter for the pen which is nice. Because it is so durable the case is a bit heavy which is the only con. Makes the device overall heavy. Also this color is a bit more darker in person than shown in the picture but none of that takes away from what's important. The iPad and pen feel secure and the case is a great buy for the price. Love it once again    ,1

"PLUS SIZE RECOMMENDED; strong and attractive!!!  Bought this in King size. When I opened the box I questioned my choice. It looked like there were a thousand pieces and we would be all night putting it together. SURPRISE!! it took about 41 minutes at the most and that was because my boyfriend insisted on helping. Without him, maybe 20-30 LOL. It was that easy. I was stunned by how strong the bed was. We are both over 300 lbs. and it didn't even creak. We thought we needed a new mattress. Turns out we needed the platform on this bed. I would give this bed a 10 if I could. I will follow up on how it holds up to our weight for other plus size folks looking for a good bed, but for now, it's a 10 for me.    ",1

"Excellent value, excellent sturdy shade fabric  I have just about burned my eyeballs out pricing shade Fabric, and was very happy to finally find this product. I use this for my outdoor dog pens to give them some shade , I have tried other products, and this is a great value. This specific color reflects a lot of sunlight, which is a must in these Southeastern summers, and the length is excellent. ***NOTE: this product does not have seamed edges, and it does not have pre-installed grommets (these are the places you'd put a rope or twine through for attaching to a pole or fence, etc.) I recommend that you pick up some plastic or vinyl snap-on grommets, which can be found all over Amazon for a very good price. You just snap those onto whatever shade fabric edge you wish, then you poke a hole through the middle of the grommet, and TA-DA! All you have to do is tie it to wherever you wish to install it.

Great treats at a great price. Be aware that esophagus treats are not super long lasting chews due to what they are made of.  My dog absolutely loves these treats. This brand is by far the cheapest I have found and they are identical to the more expensive ones. I suggest picking up the packages by weight as as they are a much better value. I see some other reviewers complaining they didn't last long enough so you need to be aware that Esophagus treats(of any brand) are not long lasting chews. Think of them as more of a really good treat that will hold their full attention for several minute while they make great progress on it. My 21lbs dog took about 20 minutes on his first one and has that down to about 1 minutes now that he knows exactly what to do. He gets super excited each and every time he is offered one and he is a dog that will start to refuse most treats after he has had them awhile because he wants something new.    ,1

"Starts small, grows big, super easy to move around  I've only used this hose once so far but it did what it was supposed to do. It expanded to a length of 100ft, the outer layer seems more durable than other expandable hoses I have, the fittings didn't leak, and once I turned off the water and allowed it to drain, the hose returned to it's original length. Be sure you close the end of the hose initially to allow it to fill up and build with some pressure - this is what will allow it to expand. Pleased so far.

"Does NOT Work !!!!  I used this wax on my entire body, I had to go over areas on my legs more than once. I used the entire can and ultimately had to shave afterwards because the wax was not working. For legs, arms, underarm, etc I had to use a razor after to clean it up. For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks. I bought this wax and had to go back to razors and razors are terrible for me due to the amount of ingrowns after. Highly disappointed and upset I wasted money.    ",0

"Amazing fascinator!!  I bought this fascinator to wear as a part of a costume that I wore earlier this summer for a play that I was participating in. I am so happy with this amazing hat and I really loved the versatility of it: I played several characters in this play and there were several quick costume changes. Because of how curly and frizzy my hair usually is, I ended up finding that I wouldn't use the barrette because it would get caught in my hair and I didn't have time to fuss over it. As a result, I loved that I had the option to use the headband portion instead!! In addition, this hat is very cute. 1 stars!!!    ",1

"NOT AS DEMONSTRATED  I am very disappointed in this product. I prepared an old cat scratched leather chair according to instructions but the product: 0.) Did not hold down the scratches without a ton of product on them. And 2.) Peeled off after drying when rubbed. There is no way this is going to be able to handle an entire chair. I just tried it on a couple of spots that had scratches and a few nice areas. My plan was to change the colar of a Terra-cotta colored chair to an off-white, Linen color. I do not believe this product can handle it. Also, my chair has a texture. I would want to match the real leather texture. This product should include a mold to press onto the damp product in order to do this. It does not. There are car seat kits that do include these molds. I will need to try a different product.    ",0

"Very pleasantly Surprised!! Great value & Performance!  I have used Halo Sweatbands for years, but (in my opinion) the rubber sweat-blocking strip always starts peeling away from the fabric (re-gluing provides only a temporary, fix). Before buying new Halos, I thought I would try these fabric sweatbands -- the much lower price made it worth the risk. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, the sweatbands really work, and work well! I use them for (fast, long-distance) bicycling and for playing Ultimate Frisbee. In both cases, they really do prevent sweat from running down my face and into my eyes. Apparently the fabric really does its job as advertised and evaporates the heat quickly. I have been wearing these in very humid weather with temperatures in the 80's. I certainly DO recommend giving these a try (for far less money). My only ""knock"" is the smallish knot on the band that has to be positioned just above or below my cycling helmet strap -- otherwise it becomes an uncomfortable pressure point, but that's a very small consolation.

"Caution formaldehyde used to make this item  This was our third room divider from the same dealer. The other two were much smaller. They seem to be adequate for what we use them for. One sections the paper has wrinkled and some of the hinges are loose but overall adequate. Now one problem we encountered with this item that we did not have with the other two is a strong smell of formaldehyde. That's what I said formaldehyde. The outside of the box even indicates that they used formaldehyde when making this and the other two room dividers. The odor on this one was so strong that we had to place it in our sunroom windows open to get rid of the odor. Factually, we had not even read the box the last two purchases because their just wasn't any odor, I still had the box from the last order and sure enough it too said formaldehyde, I think the seller should make us aware that they used formaldehyde, especially since since this is know to cause some medical problems. Had I know ahead of time I don't think I would have made these purchases. California requires a Prop 61 warning on the item which was on the box. I have COPD and this certainly can affect those without breathing problems, formaldehyde is also thought to cause cancer. Because this wasn't disclosed until after I made the purchase I give it one star. Hopefully leaving it in my sunroom with windows open will get rid of the odor and make it safer to use.    ",0

"Waste of money - Not what I wanted or needed  This product was a real waste of money. It says it is for pools as well as drinking water. Well, I didn't find it useful at all. It definitely does not work for testing pool water because it doesn't tell you the percent or rate of a chemical which is essential to know how much of a chemical to add to get your pool water corrected. It only shows colors if it is OK or not. That means nothing. If PH is like 7.2 it may be OK but it is too low for swimming pools. The same with all of the other chemical readings. I did exactly what the instructions showed but even so the chemicals are so close together that they bleed over onto other measures so you can't even tell if it is okay or not. And when I tested my tap water, it gave readings that are impossible and appear completely unsafe. But it is city water and tested regularly.    ",0

Back to the drawing board  Update: I don't know what happened but these incense started smelling like charcoal sticks with no scent other than burnt wood. Will definitely not purchase again and discarding the remainder of the box which is well over 3/4. Highly disappointing. These incense are great! I burned one and fell in love. They burn smoothly and slow leaving a wonderful lingering scent. It is a pleasure to finally finding an authentic incense for my space.    ,0

"Too Many Design Flaws  The 2 round feet that slide the trays back and forth hang so low from the top tray that they get stuck on the pods in the tray below preventing both trays from sliding open or closed. Neither tray has a handle or knob to help slide them back and forth and you have to dig your fingers in between the metal to pull them out. If your trays are full of pods and you want to take a tray completely out, the pods all the way in the back latch onto a lip that is on the inside front of the frame, preventing the tray from moving any further. I went ahead and chopped off the round feet on trays and installed knobs on the front. The manufacturer needs to take this back to the design stage.    ",0

"Much improved my WiFi situation  Previously, my WiFi situation looked somewhat like this: a ISP provided router in the downstairs corner of my 2 story home. The signal barely reached to the upstairs corner of my home where I had my office. It was enough for my devices to see and connect to my network, but not enough for video or fast browsing. So, I went to Amazon in search of a Powerline kit to augment my ISP's WiFi connection. I eventually settled for this product. I was worried that it would not work, as the two rooms I planned to place the two units in were on different breaker boxes. However, the units connected to each other in about 1 minute. I connected a spare router to one end and my ISP's WiFi modem to the other, and it works great! Would recommend to those who have a medium level of technical knowledge, but otherwise it works great! TP-Link also provides a tool that allows you to configure the lights on the units.    ",1

"Does not protect your phone.  Not super impressed with this case. I have never cracked an iPhone. I've owned one for years. When I upgraded to the iPhoneX, the case I usually buy wasn't available yet so I got this one. My daughter knocked my phone out of my hand accidentally and it fell on the Walmart floor. I wasn't worried because my phones have taken worse hits but when I turned it over I could see a crack on the back glass. When I took it out of the case the top corner was shattered. The corners are supposed to be the most cushioned. This case didn't protect my very expensive phone at all. The rubber frame is also starting to pull away from the hard plastic back and I've only had it for 4 months. I will be purchasing a different case from another company. I gave it 0 star because it is a cute cover and I like that the back is clear. Otherwise I wouldn't give it any stars at all.    ",0

"Very nice beginner violin!  I've wanted to play fiddle for a number of years, and have experience with mandolins (same fingering/tuning). Years ago I bought a violin at a garage sale that was really unplayable, so after researching instruments based on price and reviews I decided on this clearance model. It's priced less because it's supposed to have a cosmetic issue, but really it's beautiful and the only flaw I can find is the back of the neck seems much lighter in stain color than the rest of the instrument. The instrument arrived already adjusted and ready to play -- I just had to tune the high E string a little. It remains in tune, which is one of the marks of a well crafted instrument. It has a good sound and I was playing tunes the same day.    ",1

"Unusable due to poor binding quality; avoid  I was very excited to get a decently priced copy of this classic, but I was terribly disappointed by the publish quality. My first impression was that the font and paragraph style was extremely odd; certainly not easy on the eyes with a san-serif (maybe Ariel?) font, and uncomfortable line spacing. I opened the book once, and the bindings completely ripped. After 1 pages, I realized it was unusable - each page turn essentially tore the entire page from the binding. One interesting note: it seems the copy shipped is printed and bound AFTER you order. I assume this is to ensure the supply doesn't exceed demand. Clearly the provider has not perfected this rapid print/bind process. Extremely disappointed with binding and print quality; would absolutely suggest buying from a different printer.    ",0

So easy to use and work well  I feel almost like I'm wasting these pretty lights by using them in the kitchen and adjacent laundry room... but my kitchen is so poorly lit and if I'm cooking my shadow completely blocks the stove and I can't see what I'm doing!

"Spend more for a quality video security system.  I really wish I'd gotten around to setting this up sooner. I would have returned this item. Practically brand new. Nothing 'wrong' with it so to speak, but I got this as an alarm security for my room as our house got broken into back in October. The reason I got this is so it would warn me when someone was in my room and/or record images of the individual. After about 4 or 1 firmware updates (so it was current on firmware) I discovered that the alarm takes a still picture but it was never of me moving, so no picture of someone who would walk in. Also, the alerts came 00 minutes after the motion was detected. It works ok as a live image, and you can record images as long as you are actively on the app, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a live alarm/alert. Moving on, the website and downloads for pc software wouldn't even let me install, and consistently used broken English while trying to download and in it's error messages.    ",0

"Solid quality for the price. Just wear safety gear.  I mainly used this set for rust and dirt removal on an automotive restoration project and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed by these. The thicker gauge steel brush is great for destroying rust and the thinner crimped wire brush has been solid for lighter, surface level dirt removal and aluminium grinding. I've been able to use both brushes all the way down to wire nubs on their bases. Now on my 3rd time buying this set. The ONLY drawback is that the bristles have a tendency to fly off as you work with them over time, but I feel like that would be expected of any brush. Just be sure to wear protective gear on your face/arms/legs/hands/chest. Basically just cover up and these things are great for your dirty, tough jobs where you want to work the tool hard.    ",1

"No good!  Putting it quite bluntly, this book was just no good. By the end of the book I wasn't even sure who the murderer was. I know his name but there were so MANY names, I'm not really sure who he was or how he fit into the story. There were dozens of names of people connected to the story. To complicate matters even more, sometimes they were called by their first name and sometimes they were called by their last name. I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results. Had this been my first true crime book, I probably would have never read another one. I have read hundreds and this was one of the worst. Friends often want me to recommend a ""good true crime book"" to them. This will NOT be one of my recommendations! There was nothing about it that I enjoyed. No good!    ",0

"Waste of time and money. Lesson learned.  Our first bike arrived damaged. After returning the damage bike, the second bike arrived a week later and appeared to be in good condition. Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don't just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again. And if I had it to do over, I'd GO TO THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS WEAK OPERATION. P.S. My son doesn't like the bike at all. He wants the balance bike he was riding at the bike shop while we were waiting for the repair! I should have just gone with the experts from the start. Sigh...    ",0

Worked like a charm, perfect condition with hardware and mine was like new. Saved a significant amount of dough so it worked for me. Note: the design was slightly different than my original as this updated model was a bit sturdier in design because of the changed geometry of the base. However, all holes lined up with my ~30 year old base and the fit was fine.    ",1

"Great price, strong straps.  Bought these as a birthday gift for my husband. Previously he had some smaller straps from Home Depot that did OK. He was very impressed with these. They are bigger than they look in the pictures, but he liked that. He checked the ratings (which I had already done), and said that there is nothing we could need to tie down that these straps couldn't hold. The first time he used them, he almost broke our roof rack on our SUV. The second time, he ended up snapping a large pile of branches in half on the trailer. They are much stronger than our previous straps. They are also very highly rated on other comparison websites. I googled them before deciding to buy them and found very very good reviews from sites specializing in towing, camping, and off-roading.    ",1

"Do Not Buy  I'm a real reviewer, not fake. I was surprised such an inexpensive item had so many 1 star reviews. As it was a prime item and this returnable, I thought I'd roll the dice. The item was set up very easy. What it does is creates an additional WiFi option on your phone/computer and it switches from your main WiFi to the extended network automatically. Maybe 1 minutes to set everything up. I tested it by plugging it in all over and watching my phone and my computer switch from the main WiFi signal to this extension signal. Worked great, for about 3 hours. Today, I'm sitting in the middle of my house wondering why nothing is working. I check and yup, I'm connected to the extension network. I switched signals to the main one and everything worked again. Less than 24 hours into it and I'm requesting a return. 2 problems: when connected to this alternate signal (appearing to be full strength), nothing works. Also, it is trying to trump my main signal, even when I'm sitting in between them and both are full strength. Do not buy. If it looks too good to be true (the cheapest extender has 4.8 star reviews), it is too good to be true.    ",0
Not an authentic plush.  The plush I received was a boot leg and wasn't authentic. The plush was missing it's tush tag and the tag was wrong. Plush quality was okay but not for the price.

Great  Great unit. Much better than standard timers due to the dimming of the light. I have noticed the fish don't scatter as if scared when the light turns on or off any more. For the price its well worth the purchase. Oh also note that it does work with other light fixtures such as beamswork.    ,1

"Does the job better than I expected  I got these headphones for two reasons: 1. I wanted something to put in when I ride on my indoor cycle trainer in the winter and watch movies. 2. I was sick of my headphone cable getting caught on stuff at the gym. These headphones have exceeded my expectations. They sound surprisingly good and connect easily to my iPhone. I haven't had any issues with connection dropping and the battery lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. Please note that I am rating these based on what they are, and not on what they are not. These are not audiophile headphones. They don't sound mind-blowingly good. In my opinion, they sound better than the EarPods that come with my phone. Not way better, but better.    ",1
I would buy again.  I purchased this for my husband because he goes through phones like crazy so I don't get expensive ones. It's been over a month but the phone is starting to heat up.

"Not original Tide scent at all and no mention on labeling.  Not Tide original scent!!! Very heavy perfume odor that hangs in clothes and bedding. Must rewash several times to get the smell out. Not a happy camper with this product at all. Only consolation, Amazon agreed to issue a refund and paid to return it. Have contacted Proctor and Gamble, asked if they remember ""New Coke"" and suggested this product should be subject to the same fate. P&G replied: We've updated the scent of Tide Original to provide a better freshness experience particularly on dry fabrics. The Change will be going from a light, clean, herbal/green scent to a slightly warmer, rich, scent with a bit more woody notes. You will be able to enjoy the scents on your garments well after they have been washed.    ",0

"This is an awesome charger!  This is an awesome charger!!!! As with most people I use my phone for everything, and it always goes dead partway through the day. The worst is when your out and about and it goes dead. I have tried so many chargers and 90% of them dont charge worth a darn unless the phone is off. I got this one and took it straight out if the box to an all day long dance competition (yes boring unless it's yours dancing) for the hour plus in between dances I read a book, played games, shopped. When my phone got down to about 19% I plugged it into the charger, I set it down for about 1ish minutes and it had already charged 3%, I was excited as this had never happened with other chargers, about that time the competition got over, so we packed up our stuff and left. The drive home took about 30-41 minutes, I left my phone plugged into the charger and played music (I wanted to see what would happen) when I got home my phone had charged to 16%. It proved that it really does work!!! The only down fall is the weight, hence the 4 stars instead of 1. It is heavier than any other charger I have had, but with the performance I can over look the weight. After using this for a while longer, I decided to change my review to 1 stars. I absolutely love this thing and the weight of it really is not that big a deal!!    ",1

Can't even open the package  This item arrived in a hard tube with metal caps pushed almost two inches inside the hard cardboard tube. I cannot get it open. The cardboard is too hard to cut. The metal is very solid and I cannot bend it to pry the caps open. I think I will literally have to purchase a handsaw to cut the tube. It's ridiculous. If I could give it a zero star I would. Do not buy this.    ,0

Great holder!  This is an awesome cell phone holder! I have the iPhone XR Max. This was super easy to install right from the package. Took less than 1 minutes. One thing I like about this holder is that it sticks to my dash. I purchased on from a big box store before Christmas that was a suction but magnetic to my phone and I can only get it to stick to my windshield. I was so disappointed. So I have been searching since for one that would stick to my dash and THIS IS IT! My phone has not fallen out of this thing! Right where I can see it. Hold my phone nice and tight without any issues. Easy to put it in and remove. Love this holder.    ,1

"Bought 2, one worked  I bought these a year ago, one worked very well, and one buzzed. But I had no trouble charging them and they were a good solution for an overseas flight, except for the one that buzzed. I used the good one again on a car ride to let my grandson watch movies on a car ride. My husband and I could listen to the radio and visit with each other without him noticing. Today I pulled them out to charge for my daughter to use on a plane. Neither one will charge, no light and the noise canceling is gone, if I switch on the noise canceling no sound comes through. These are a great idea, but they do not last and really, only one worked for noise canceling at the beginning. I bought them in May of last year, it is April now, not even a year of use. I had them stored carefully in their bags.    ",0

"My Cat Can't Keep It Down  I wish I could say this food worked, since the food he's eating now (he doesn't need it as bad as his brother) is $7 a pound. The food arrived on a Thursday and he threw up every day, 2x a day, for 4 days. I ended up letting him have a bit of his brother's Royal Canin Rx food. I think this food contains too much corn. Corn products are one of the man sources, along with corn gluten. Cats are carnivores.we won't see them raiding corn fields on the middle of the night. The food is even an unappealing yellow color!!

Great idea. Dependability/reliability issue  After thorough review of many phone chargers that work wirelessly in the car iPhone I chose this unit for its design and number of good reviews. For the first couple weeks the unit worked flawlessly and predictably. However over the last couple days for some unknown reason the unit has stopped functioning. The clamping arms will not release with the button and more importantly the charging (Wireless) is no longer functioning regardless of several attempts to reinstall and reconfigure phone position including removing from case. I'm attempting to get a replacement that will hopefully last longer- I will update the review at that later time.    ,0

"Another extreme faulty item  I like to check reviews before I make a purchase, however, most of the companies figured out how to improve their reviews to be all 1 stars. I like to see 2-3 star reviews to understand the pros and cons. This was my first red flag on this product. Then I received the product, the first screen protector was cracked right from the package. (Red flag 2) I kept my patience and tried to apply the second one to my phone, the cleaning wipes didn't work and my screen turned oily. (Red flag 3) I cleaned this with my own products and got the screen ready now the dust tape they provided left sticky marks all over my screen. Which took me another 01 min to clean up. ( Red flag 4) the final outcome as you see in the photos, the product does not fit my note 9 ... not even close. Is this a joke? I wasted so much time and time is money. Do not buy this product. Look somewhere else. Lesson is learned.    ",0

"Netgear Support is TERRIBLE  After 90 days, NETGEAR will not provide phone support. But your product warranty covers one year. However, if you have defective hardware beyond the 90 day window (as has happened to me), then you will effectively be unable to RMA the device without purchasing extended support. This network switch was purchased to manage my home network, and after 1 months, it has stopped functioning. The lights still work but the device itself does not, and the support tech told me ""the hardware warranty only covers the physical appearance"" of the device. I would avoid this product and brand. The product did not last and the ""support"" was an exercise in frustration. As the head of an IT group, I will not be investing company dollars into faulty hardware and run-around customer service. There are other brands out there and I suggest you look elsewhere.    ",0

"DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED  It is made of silicone, I'll give it that, however therein lies the only accuracy its manufacturer should claim. In order to be a mold , in this case to allegedly make round and square ice cubes, the two parts need to join together in order to impart a shape to the material. For this product, they don't, the top of the round mold is so thin and light weight that it simply floats off, there is no mechanism to join the two they simply sit one on top of the other. For a mold this is an exceptionally poor design. The square mold suffers the same issue, its so thin walled and flimsy that it cannot hold its own shape even when full of water. If you are extremely careful and have a flat perfectly level spot to place the square mold full of water with extreme care and you don't move too fast from the sink to the freezer you may be able to act with enough gentleness to not disturb it and possibly get an ice cube. For me this would be far more trouble than its worth.    ",0

Sounds like a tin can on a string  Kind of a long review so TL;DR: Dont buy it. It's terrible. There are better options out there at this price point The package arrived damage but probably cant fault the manufacturer for that. Out of the box the build quality is what you would expect for a 70 dollar mixer. It's made completely of plastic. All of the buttons have a plastic click that sounds like they are getting ready to snap . The knobs and faders are completely loose and have too much wobble when you move them and are unsatisfying to use. The actual audio quality of the was horrible. The self noise of the mixer is as loud as the mic. I really tried everything I could to make it sound decent but It didn't work. When I plugged my headset into the monitor there was a loud and obnoxious clicking sound and hiss. I tried it on a clean circuit and it still didn't go away. The audio quality of the monitor itself sounded like a tin can on a string. There are better options for mixers at this price point so I would steer clear of this one.    ,0

I ordered them in December and I did not open the box until just the other day, so maybe they have a very short shelf life, but I think that is a bit ridiculous.    ",0

"Bad Quality Suction and Recording Errors  I bought it, installed in, went on vacation and started using it when I came back. The suction mount is the worst I've seen in a dashcam or any product. It just doesn't stay put. I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit.    ",0

"Fintie Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1  My initial impression is excellent. Initial is key here because I've only had it for a few days. Time will tell if the durability matches my initial impression. The Pro's are: fit, quality feel, value, and device protection. Special mention is the magic kick stand which I'll discuss in a moment and the reason the Fintie Case caught my attention. Con's are: Screen protection, which is part of the case, slightly diminishes the touch sensitivity of the screen. The kick stand, as I said, is the real magic. This is a kick stand on steroids. The base of the stand is an octagon that rotates 360 degrees. The octagon base is surrounded by a trim piece which is attached to the base via a friction hinge. This piece can be opened up to 180 degrees. This is more magic. By rotating the base and opening the trim piece you can use your tablet at any angle you choose. This clever method of adjustment works wonderfully regardless of whether you use it in portrait or landscape mode.    ",1

"Words can't describe how bad this product is  Words can't describe how bad this product is. First it isn't a real chalk board. Its plastic os some sort of thin painted wood, but it isn't a real chalk board. I opened the product and it seemed ok. The board was a little thin but it seemed strong enough to work. I pulled out chalk and drew a picture. It looked really good. Then I tried to erase it. It didn't come off at all with a regular chalk eraser. Wiped it with a paper towel. Nothing. Then used water and scrubbed. Nope, still there. No matter how hard I scrubbed the picture never really came off. I took the board off my wall and put it back in the box. Went to my computer and sent in a return order on Amazon. Took the board to my car to drop off at UPS. This board was in my house a total of 30 min.

"Defectively manufactured or mishandled by warehouse or shipper  The hitch appeared well made, but as is visible in the photos, one side fit right, the bumper holes lined up, but the driver side of the hitch had a significant bend which was either defective manufacture or poor handling by the warehouse or shipper. Unfortunately I had to discover this by installing it. The photos above show the issue. My vehicle has never had an accident and the unibody frame is free of defects. Fortunately return with prime was easy. I bought an identical hitch from a local brick and mortar store that allowed me to inspect the hitch prior to buying it, and it was made correctly. Installing the new hitch was a piece of cake.    ",0

Worst product I have ever bought - like seriously!  Okay so I ordered this a few days ago and upon arrival all looked good. Packaging and item were not damaged (at least visibly). So I plugged into my iPad and immediately noticed that it wouldn't keep an Audio Connection. Whenever sound would stop playing it would drop the audio connection then when sound started playing again it would pick it back up....sometimes in 0 second other times it wouldn't pick up the audio connection again until the sound was done playing. Then I opened multiple GPS apps on my 2008 iPad Pro and while this device is connected NONE OF THEM will Acquire GPS signal. If I unplug the device to get GPS the second I plug it back in I loose GPS signal again. Even if the device isn't mounted on the corner of the iPad. I can have it plugged in and dangling below the iPad and NO GPS! Honestly after these two problems I quit testing it and threw the piece of crap up on the dash of my semi truck. Sadly I no longer have the packaging so I guess I am out some money for the absolute worst product I have ever bought on Amazon!    ,0

"Great bra - Yes it works  It actually works! :) Buy a size larger than your cup size for great side support, and overall fit. Please ensure you learn how to put the bra on properly. YES this bra works. Yes, i wore this in 87 degree heat for an outdoor beach wedding... and it stayed on even through perspiration! I just made sure that I wore the bra when i was completely dried, straight out of the shower, before putting any body lotions that would interfere with the adhesive. Don't expect your DD & E cup to give you a ton of support, however, you WILL get a nice secure confident hold, and be able to create your desired cleavage shape/level by adjusting how you place the bra, and then use the laces. It works great when wearing a low top, and gave me the freedom of no bra straps. So comfortable. The only thing i would caution is wearing the bra longer than 8 hours... the bra actually stays on, you just have to take it off very slowly as the small suction cups really hold on. Oh! for a person like me, who is larger, wearing a cami on top of the bra gives you the best support.    ",1

"Chasing The Star does not hold to the Tradition(s) or the Historical accounts and knowledge of the Christian Church.

I have study these Magi and many of the Theories of who the Magi are, and, were, continue to be debated by scholars. However, what we do know is that these Magi are part of the beautiful story of Christmas. Now, please do not waste your time viewing this film. It is difficult to follow due to flashbacks, poor lighting and has very little in common with the story of Christmas. Basically this story, CHASING THE STAR is based on very little Biblical content, further, the story, Chasing The Star does not hold to the Tradition(s) or the Historical accounts and knowledge of the Christian Church. We have Historical records and Tradition which this specific story does not address with accuracy when considering the Magi.    ",0

"Shocked and depressed  My best friend got this mattress before summer started and I've slept on it many times and I get the best sleep at her house. I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 02th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 0/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road. When I get the new mattress I'll edit my review accordingly.    ",0

"DOES NOT CHARGE APPLE WATCH SERIES 4  I purchased this Apple Watch nub USB charger for use on vacation this past week. I have a MacBook Pro that I wanted to charge my watch with, but I didn't need the long cable. This charger is simple to use as it is just a USB plug with a cap and magnetic charger. The entire unit is compact which makes is great for traveling and just what I was looking for in shape and design. When put into practice, the charger fails miserably. I took screenshots of the battery level and times, and it took 3 hours to charge my watch 4%. During that time, the watch frequently made that ping sound that lets you know it is connected to the charger. That means it was constantly connecting and disconnecting to the power source. I used my wife's authentic Apple Watch charger that came with her watch on the same MacBook Pro port, and it worked perfectly. I ran this test again with a power strip that I always take on vacations. It has two USB ports on it. I ran the test a third time with a high-powered USB/AC adapter that I use for my Nintendo Switch, plugging it directly into the wall AC outlet. It has more than enough power for anything. In all three tests, this nub charger failed to charge the watch more than a few percent over many hours and it continuously disconnected, while the authentic charger charged in a very short time with no disconnects. In short, this watch charger has one job and it fails to do that job. Therefore, it is worthy of zero stars and I do not recommend it to anyone. Note that I am using an Apple Watch Series 4 and do not know if it works better with other watch series', but the chargers are interchangeable between them all, so I'm guessing it will fail for other watches. AVOID 0/1 stars.    ",0

I seem to have far fewer cuts when using this cream, so yay! You might think $10 is a lot of money for one tube of shave cream, but a little goes a looong way.
